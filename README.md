Spotify playlist manager is a Next.js App integrated with NextAuth to interact with the Spotify API.

Project is (subjectively) styled using BEM methodology paired with TailwindCSS in individual SASS files, creating a separation of concerns which in turn keeps the JSX syntax clean and readable.

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create an .env.local file in the root folder (see .env.template for an example) and fill all environment variables.

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
